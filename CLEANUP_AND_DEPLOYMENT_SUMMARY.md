## 🚀 Production-Ready Features

### 1. ✅ Username-Based Storage
```
storage/
  ├── <username>/
  │   ├── uploads/      # Active encrypted files
  │   └── deleted/      # Soft-deleted files
```

**Implementation:**
- All storage operations use `username` instead of `user_id`
- Folder structure: `storage/<username>/uploads/` and `storage/<username>/deleted/`
- Automatic folder creation on user registration

### 2. ✅ Real-Time Synchronization

**Features:**
- 🔄 Auto-refresh every 10 seconds
- 📤 Event-driven refresh on file upload
- 🗑️ Immediate UI update on file deletion
- 📋 Console logging for all operations

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Auto-refresh interval
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(fetchFiles, 10000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);

// Event listener for uploads
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('fileUploaded', fetchFiles);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('fileUploaded', fetchFiles);
}, []);
```

### 3. ✅ Secure File Operations

#### Upload Flow:
```
Original File (test.pdf)
    ↓ Client-side encryption (AES-256-GCM)
Encrypted Blob
    ↓ Upload to backend
Stored as: uuid.enc in storage/<username>/uploads/
    ↓ Metadata saved to PostgreSQL
Database record with original filename
```

#### Download Flow:
```
User clicks download
    ↓ Fetch encrypted file from backend
Encrypted Blob (.enc)
    ↓ Client-side decryption
Decrypted Blob
    ↓ Restore original filename & format
Save as: test.pdf (original format)
```

#### Delete Flow:
```
User deletes file
    ↓ Move file
From: storage/<username>/uploads/uuid.enc
To:   storage/<username>/deleted/uuid.enc
    ↓ Update database
Status: active → deleted
    ↓ Refresh UI
File removed from list immediately
```

### 4. ✅ Enhanced UI/UX

**Console Logging:**
- 📋 File list operations
- 📥 Download progress
- 🗑️ Delete operations
- 🔓 Decryption status
- ⚠️ Error messages

**Features:**
- Progress indicators for all operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states
- Toast notifications

### 5. ✅ TypeScript Compilation

**Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ `import.meta.env` errors resolved
- ✅ Type assertions added: `(import.meta as any).env`
- ✅ Clean build with no errors
- ✅ Production-ready TypeScript code
