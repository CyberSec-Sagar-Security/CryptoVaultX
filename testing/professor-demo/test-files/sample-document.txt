This is a sample text file for encryption testing.

Content includes:
- Plain text paragraphs
- Numbers: 1234567890
- Special characters: !@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?
- Unicode characters: 🔐🚀✨💻🛡️

This file will be encrypted using AES-256-GCM algorithm.
The encryption should preserve all content perfectly.

Test data for professor demonstration:
- Original file size: [will be calculated]
- Encryption algorithm: AES-256-GCM
- Key size: 256 bits
- IV size: 96 bits (12 bytes)

End of test file.
