# 🚨 FINAL CLEANUP STEPS

## ⚠️ Manual Cleanup Required

Due to active processes, some directories couldn't be automatically moved. Please perform these final steps when services are stopped:

### 1. **Remove Original Directories** (After stopping all services)
```powershell
# Stop all running services first, then:
Remove-Item -Path "backend" -Recurse -Force
Remove-Item -Path "Frontend_New" -Recurse -Force
```

### 2. **Update .gitignore** (If needed)
Add any new patterns for the organized structure:
```
# Core modules
core/backend/__pycache__/
core/backend/uploads/*.enc
core/frontend/node_modules/
core/frontend/dist/
core/frontend/.vite/

# Operations
operations/logs/
operations/temp/

# Testing
testing/temp/
testing/results/
```

### 3. **Verify Structure**
After cleanup, your final structure should be:
```
CryptoVaultX/
├── 📁 core/
├── 📁 operations/  
├── 📁 testing/
├── 📁 docs/
├── 📁 archive/
├── .gitignore
├── .vscode/
├── start.ps1
├── PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
└── CLEANUP_COMPLETE.md
```

## ✅ **What's Already Done**
