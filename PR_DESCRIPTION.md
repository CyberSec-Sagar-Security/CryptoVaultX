# feat(storage): local encrypted upload/download + decrypt + 512MB quota

## Summary
This PR implements **local per-user filesystem storage** for encrypted files, replacing PostgreSQL blob storage. All encryption/decryption occurs client-side using AES-256-GCM via Web Crypto API. The server never receives plaintext or encryption keys.

## Changes

### Backend
- ✅ **Per-user folder automation**: Folders `./storage/<user_id>/uploads/` and `./storage/<user_id>/deleted/` are automatically created on user registration
- ✅ **Separated controllers**: Upload, download, and delete logic split into dedicated controller files (`uploadController.py`, `downloadController.py`, `deleteController.py`)
- ✅ **Quota middleware**: New `quota_required` middleware enforces 512MB per-user limit (uploads + deleted folders)
- ✅ **Upload endpoint** (`POST /api/files`): Accepts multipart/form-data with encrypted file + metadata, stores ciphertext on disk, saves only metadata in PostgreSQL
- ✅ **Download endpoints** (`GET /api/files/:id` and `GET /api/files/:id/download`): Streams ciphertext with encryption metadata in headers (X-File-IV, X-File-Algo, etc.)
- ✅ **Soft delete** (`DELETE /api/files/:id`): Moves file from uploads to deleted folder, updates metadata status
- ✅ **Storage manager**: Handles all filesystem operations (create folders, save/read files, move to deleted, calculate sizes)

### Frontend
- ✅ Client-side AES-256-GCM encryption already implemented
- ✅ Upload flow sends multipart/form-data with encrypted blob + metadata JSON
- ✅ Download flow fetches ciphertext and decrypts locally
- ✅ No UI changes (per requirements)

### Database
- ✅ PostgreSQL stores **ONLY metadata**: `id`, `owner_id`, `original_filename`, `algo`, `iv`, `size_bytes`, `storage_path`, `status`, `created_at`, `deleted_at`
- ✅ **No file blobs** stored in database

## Verification Checklist

### ✅ Per-User Folder Creation
- [ ] Register new user via UI
- [ ] Verify folders exist:
  ```powershell
  Get-ChildItem .\core\backend\storage\<user_id>\uploads
  Get-ChildItem .\core\backend\storage\<user_id>\deleted
  ```
- [ ] Backend logs show: `✅ Created storage folders for user <user_id>`

**Screenshot:** `[storage_folders.png]` - Show directory structure with uploads/ and deleted/

---

### ✅ Encrypted Upload
- [ ] Upload a test file (e.g., 1MB text file) via UI
- [ ] Verify encrypted file appears in uploads folder:
  ```powershell
  Get-ChildItem .\core\backend\storage\<user_id>\uploads
  ```
- [ ] File should have `.enc` extension and UUID name
- [ ] Backend logs show: `✅ Encrypted file stored locally: <file_id>`
- [ ] Browser DevTools Network tab shows:
  - POST request to `/api/files`
  - Status: 201 Created
  - Payload: `file` (binary), `metadata` (JSON with ivBase64, algo)
  - **NO plaintext or keys visible**

**Screenshot:** `[upload_network_request.png]` - Network tab showing encrypted upload request (no sensitive data)

---

### ✅ Encrypted Download & Client-Side Decrypt
- [ ] Click download button in UI
- [ ] Browser DevTools shows:
  - GET request to `/api/files/<file_id>`
  - Status: 200 OK
  - Response headers include:
    - `X-File-Name`: original filename
    - `X-File-IV`: base64 IV
    - `X-File-Algo`: AES-256-GCM
    - `Content-Disposition`: attachment
  - Response body: Binary encrypted data
- [ ] File downloads automatically
- [ ] Open downloaded file - content matches original (not garbled)
- [ ] Backend logs show: `✅ File downloaded: <file_id>`

**Optional - Checksum verification:**
```powershell
Get-FileHash .\original.txt
Get-FileHash ~\Downloads\downloaded.txt
# Hashes should match
```

**Screenshot:** `[download_decrypt.png]` - Network tab showing download response headers + successfully decrypted file

---

### ✅ Soft Delete (Move to Deleted Folder)
- [ ] Click delete button, confirm deletion
- [ ] Verify file moved:
  ```powershell
  # Uploads should be empty
  Get-ChildItem .\core\backend\storage\<user_id>\uploads
  
  # Deleted should have file with timestamp prefix
  Get-ChildItem .\core\backend\storage\<user_id>\deleted
  ```
- [ ] Backend logs show: `✅ File soft deleted: <file_id> → storage/<user_id>/deleted/<timestamp>_<uuid>.enc`
- [ ] Database query shows:
  ```sql
  SELECT status, deleted_at FROM files WHERE id = '<file_id>';
  -- status='deleted', deleted_at is set
  ```

**Screenshot:** `[soft_delete.png]` - Directory showing file moved from uploads/ to deleted/

---

### ✅ Quota Enforcement (512MB Limit)
- [ ] Create large test file:
  ```powershell
  fsutil file createnew .\dummy_600mb.bin 629145600
  ```
- [ ] Try to upload via UI
- [ ] Expected response:
  - Status: 413 Payload Too Large
  - Error message: "User storage quota (512MB) exceeded"
  - File does NOT appear in storage folders
- [ ] Browser DevTools shows:
  - POST to `/api/files`
  - Status: 413
  - Response: `{"error": "quota_exceeded", "message": "..."}`
- [ ] Clean up:
  ```powershell
  Remove-Item .\dummy_600mb.bin
  ```

**Screenshot:** `[quota_rejected.png]` - Network tab showing HTTP 413 response for over-quota upload

---

### ✅ Storage Quota API
- [ ] GET `/api/files/quota`
- [ ] Response includes:
  ```json
  {
    "storage_info": {
      "used_bytes": <number>,
      "quota_bytes": 536870912,
      "quota_mb": 512,
      "remaining_bytes": <number>,
      "uploads_bytes": <number>,
      "deleted_bytes": <number>
    }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Verify: `uploads_bytes + deleted_bytes = used_bytes`
- [ ] Verify: `remaining_bytes = 536870912 - used_bytes`
